        How and Where Did People Die On The Job in the U.S.?

        I scraped workplace fatality data from <a href="https://www.osha.gov/fatalities">OSHA's website</a>, and charted what I found. 

        There are a total of 6,500 cases on the website. I removed two as they were repeated
        cases, and analyzed 6,498 cases. Scraping the union status required an additional step of
        going into each case and extracting the information, and I managed to get 6,433 cases, 
        which I believe is still sizable:</strong>

        <h3>Number of cases</h3>
        <p>
            <p>Workplace deaths in the U.S. have been falling since 2019, according to cases inspected by
            the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
            between January 2017 and November 2022. </p>

            <iframe title="Number of workplace deaths in the U.S. " aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-JSA1U" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JSA1U/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
            </script>
    
            However, this could also be due to the pandemic, when some companies stopped worked and their
            workers stayed home. Or that OSHA has not updated the table to include more recent cases. OSHA 
            states on its website that the information is not comprehensive and is updated when the data 
            becomes available.
    
            The number of workplace deaths on OSHA's website do not tally with the Bureau
            of Labor Statistics' (BLS) data. For example, BLS' data showed there were 
            <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.htm">5,190 fatal work injuries in 2021</a>, up from 4,764 in 2020. In 2019, there were 5,333 deaths.

        <h3>How workers died</h3>

            <p>Most workers died by falling or being struck by objects. Covid-19 related deaths were not
            counted in this analysis.</p>
            
            <iframe title="Most workers died after they fell or were struck by a heavy object" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-AAh5q" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AAh5q/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
            </script>

        <h3>Where deaths occurred</h3>
    
           <p>Texas, California, and Florida had the most number of workplace deaths during this period,
            but these are also the three largest states by population in the country. After accounting
            for population, Oregon, North Dakota, and Wyoming were the three states with the highest rate
            of workplace deaths per population. </p>

            <iframe title="Total number of workplace fatalities in each state " aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-lJp8O" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lJp8O/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="631" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
            </script>
            <iframe title="Workplace fatalities per 100,000 people in each U.S. state " aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-ZPIsS" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZPIsS/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="617" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
            </script>
            
            <p>Only states were mapped — U.S. territorities were not. OSHA also investigates deaths in territories. 
            There were 46 cases in Puerto Rico, just above New  Mexico's 43, and below Nebraska's 48. 
            The Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Mariana Islands had six, five, four, 
            and two cases respectively. Curiously, Washington state had only four cases.</p>

        <h3>How union status affected workers </h3>

            <p>Nearly 90% of workers who died were not unionzed. This is not surprising. A report 
            published by the <a href="https://illinoisepi.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/ilepi-pmcr-unions-and-construction-health-and-safety-final.pdf">Illinois Economic Policy Institute in November 2021 </a> — and <a href= "https://blog.dol.gov/2022/05/11/the-connection-between-unions-and-worker-safety">cited by OSHA</a> —
            found that union worksites had 34% fewer violations per OSHA inspection 
            than non-union ones. And while unions represented 14% of the construction industry workers, 
            their employers made up only 5% of the industry’s OSHA violations. Unions help to negotiate
            safety protocols, ensure their workers are not being put in risky situation, and help workers to
            file and bring up grievances. </p>

            <iframe title="Most cases involved non-unionized workers" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-BVRD3" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BVRD3/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
