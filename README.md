# Workplace deaths final project
Notebooks and Datawrapper images for my final semester one data journalism project. I scraped and analyzed workplace death cases recorded by OSHA.
---------
As my semester 1 final project, I used Playwright to scrape the OSHA website where the agency lists the [cases of workplace deaths it inspected](https://www.osha.gov/fatalities), and analyzed them using pandas and regex. The data is between January 2017 and November 2022. 6446 rows were analyzed. COVID-19 related deaths are not included.
